Mon January 9

Encoutered lot of problems with obtaining dataset. Wanted to compare overweight/obesity with GDP. Nowhere to be found a proper dataset for the world.
So I chose GDP versus Wealth indicators and want to look if the countries with the highest GDPs also the best score for wealth indicators have.

Tue January 10

Started writing design document. First needed to determine proper datasets. 
Therefore, I started looking for the wealth indicators. Difficult to determine what is best to use. 

### Total change of plans

Could not determine the specific wealth indicators so started to look again for obesity. Found data so I changed my topic to obesity and started to think about my new plan.
