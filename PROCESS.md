# day 1

Mon January 9

Encoutered lot of problems with obtaining dataset. Wanted to compare overweight/obesity with GDP. Nowhere to be found a proper dataset for the world.
So I chose GDP versus Wealth indicators and want to look if the countries with the highest GDPs also the best score for wealth indicators have.

# day 2

Tue January 10

Started writing design document. First needed to determine proper datasets. 
Therefore, I started looking for the wealth indicators. Difficult to determine what is best to use. 

### Total change of plans

Could not determine the specific wealth indicators so started to look again for obesity. Found data so I changed my topic to obesity and started to think about my new plan.

# day 3

Wed January 11

Written a new readme and concept before the first morning meeting. My feedback at the first morning meeting was that my story-telling aspect should be more clear. 

So decided to examine the relationship between BMI, GDP and happiness. I will try to find a trend in find a level of GDP which provides for optimal happiness and healthy level of BMI. 

Other possible variables are level of education, female/male difference and life expectancy. 

I acquired the data from the different databanks. 
* Worldbank - Population and GDP per capita
* World Health Organization - BMI, overweight and obesity
* Wikipedia - Happiness rate

New sketch of my concept. Difficult to determine in advance how all the visualizations will be linked. 

Consulted other students about proper JSON format.

In the design document I formulated how all the different visualizations interact, the datasets, my JSON format, the sketch and the libraries I'm planning to use.

Slowly I'm getting a better idea of what needs to be done. Tomorrow I will try to make the data ready to use in a javascript file. So first I need to convert my 6 CSV files to 1 JSON file in the morning. Then, in the afternoon I can create my javascript, css and html files and prepare for the friday presentation.
